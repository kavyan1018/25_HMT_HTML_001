why we use Functions ?
-> Functions are used to organize code into reusable blocks, making it easier to read, maintain, and debug. They help in breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.

types of functions :

    -> inbuilt functions
    -> user-defined functions
            -> No arguments and No return type
            -> with arguments and No return type
            -> No arguments and with return type
            -> with arguments and with return type
            -> Recursive functions

syntax of function :

        data_type : void / int
        function_name(parameters)
        {
            // body of the function
        }

        void main()
        {
            // Code here
        }



WHY do we need 4 types of functions?

Because every program has different needs:

Sometimes we only want to do a task

Sometimes we want to send data

Sometimes we want to get a result back

Sometimes we want both

So C gives us 4 combinations of:

Arguments (input)

Return value (output)
